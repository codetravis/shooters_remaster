    <h3>Prohibited Guns and Ammunition</h3>
    <p>Shotguns are no longer allowed on the range due to patrons not following our no-birdshot policy.  Guns that shoot shot shells such as a Judge are permitted only using pistol caliber cartridges.  Shot shells of any kind are prohibited.</p>
    <p>Black powder guns such as muzzle loaders and cap &amp; ball handguns are prohibited due to the fire hazard that the black powder guns present in the enclosure of an indoor range as well as the amount of smoke that they produce.</p>
    <p>We do not allow AK-47 or AR-15 pistols, guns fitted with bumper stocks, or fully automatic weapons or other like guns on the range for safety reasons.</p>
    <p>Certain ammunition <strong><u>MAY NOT BE USED</u></strong> on the range for safety reasons.  Tracers introduce a fire and safety hazard and penetrating rounds such as the "green Tip" 5.56 NATO are not safe for indoor use for a variety of reasons.  Any patron using prohibited ammunition will be escorted off the premises without any warnings.</p>
