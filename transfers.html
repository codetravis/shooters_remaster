  <h3>Transfers</h3>
  <p>We welcome any gun transfer to or from a valid FFL holder.  Our transfer fee is $25 to send or receive.</p>

  <p>We are a listed FFL dealer on <a href="http://gunbroker.com" target="_blank">GunBroker.com.</a></p>

  <a>It is our policy that we will not accept transfers from individuals as we have had issues with receiving from individuals in the past.</a>

  <p class="strong headroom">Multi-gun Transfer Fees</p>
  <p>For multiple guns received from or sent to an FFL dealer in the same shipped box, $25 for the first gun and $10 for each additional gun.  AR-15 lowers are considered a gun and the same transfer fees apply.</p>

  <p class="strong headroom">Receiving a Transfer<p>
  <p>Transfer fees and shipping charges of firearms from the originating FFL dealer we receive are the responsibility of the buyer in addition to our $25 transfer fee.</p>

  <p class="strong headroom">Sending a Transfer</p>
  <p>A transfer fee of $25 plus shipping charges will be required before a firearm is sent.  Any transfer fees charged by the FFL dealer receiving a firearm are the responsibility of the person receiving the transfer.</p>
