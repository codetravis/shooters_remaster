          <p>The cost is $15 for non-members and $10 for members.  You will need to bring a semiautomatic pistol, holster, magazine holder, ammo (bring your own or we have ammo on hand for purchase) and you can shoot any caliber handgun that you wish.  Most shoots typically use 60 to 80 rounds of ammunition.</p>
